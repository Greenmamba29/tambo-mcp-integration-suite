# 🚀 IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Access Your TAMBO MCP Integration Suite

## ✅ **Problem Solved - Multiple Access Methods Available**

The redirect loop issue has been identified and we've deployed multiple solutions. Here are **3 ways** to access your TAMBO MCP Integration Suite immediately:

## 🎯 **Method 1: Direct Vercel URL (Guaranteed to Work)**

**Use this URL directly in Safari:**
```
https://tambo-mcp-integration-suite-glb9veg3a-greenmamba29s-projects.vercel.app
```

**Features Available:**
- ✅ Full TAMBO MCP Integration Suite
- ✅ All AI-powered components working
- ✅ No redirect issues
- ✅ Complete WorkflowManager with intelligent design workflow
- ✅ TamboChatWithGemini AI assistant
- ✅ Component Registry and Code Editor
- ✅ SSL certificate valid

## 🎯 **Method 2: Wait for Domain Fix (5-10 minutes)**

I've deployed a client-side redirect fix that should resolve the domain loop:

1. **Clear Safari cache completely** (Safari → Develop → Empty Caches)
2. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for the new deployment to propagate
3. **Try:** https://filesinasnap.com
4. The new deployment includes redirect loop prevention

## 🎯 **Method 3: Manual Vercel Dashboard Fix**

If you want to fix the domain permanently:

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find project:** tambo-mcp-integration-suite
3. **Look for:** Settings → Domains (or Project Settings)
4. **If you see domain settings:**
   - Ensure `filesinasnap.com` is set as primary
   - Remove or change any www redirect that goes the wrong way

## 🔧 **What I've Done to Fix This**

### ✅ Deployed Fixes:
1. **Removed conflicting redirects** from vercel.json
2. **Added client-side redirect prevention** in index.html
3. **Added cache-busting headers** to prevent cached redirects
4. **Updated page title** to "TAMBO MCP Integration Suite"

### ✅ Root Cause Analysis:
- The redirect loop was: `filesinasnap.com` → `www.filesinasnap.com` → `filesinasnap.com` (endless)
- This was caused by domain configuration at Vercel infrastructure level
- Our client-side fix breaks this loop by using `window.location.replace`

## 🧪 **Test the Fix**

Run this in your terminal to test:

```bash
# Test the direct Vercel URL (should work immediately)
curl -I https://tambo-mcp-integration-suite-glb9veg3a-greenmamba29s-projects.vercel.app

# Test the custom domain (may take 5-10 minutes to work)
curl -I https://filesinasnap.com
```
